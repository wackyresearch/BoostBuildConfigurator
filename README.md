# BoostBuildConfigurator

## Description
Every time I wanted to create my custom Boost build it took me annoyingly long to gather all the necessary command-line arguments.
This is why I've created this small web app which let's you configure your arguments using drop-down menus. It does not support all
available options, but it might give you a good head start.

## Usage
Just go to [BoostBuildConfigurator](https://wackyresearch.github.io/BoostBuildConfigurator).
